  <h2>Francisco Duarte M:Computer Science Major in the Class of 2023</h2>

  <h4>
    A little about me...
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I am in this course to learn more about web design because what I know
      so far has many gaps and I haven't used it in a formal environemnt.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have created a few different websites for hackathons, class projects
      and personal use but they have not been great in my opinion. Here are
      two examples of the wesbites I have created.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="http://handson.franciscoduarte.net/">
            Hackaton project concept that mimicked linked in but catered to
            POC students and provided a directory of POC owened business in
            metro areas(Only Dallas is working at the time)
          </a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a target="_blank" href="http://spa345.franciscoduarte.net/">Class
            project that focuses on the impact of Covid on Latinx populations
            in the largest metro areas of the United States.
            It contains interactive maps and tables for users to explore the data gethered.
          </a>
        </li>

      </ul>
      Both of these examples are based on the original website template that I created for the hackaton in 2020 with Bootstrap.
      I have been coding on and off for about 10 years but only recently got serious about it in the past 5 or 6 years.
    </li>

    <li>
      In this course, I want to get a formal understanding of the web development process as well as dive into the backend implementation of code because in order to create the class website listed above, I had to use python packages to craete the maps and charts and then expored the results to an HTML/Json file to be displayed.

          How to use APIs: The acticity explains how to use APIs to request and obtain data. First, a simple example is shown through a URL that can be visited in a browser. Then, Postman is used to demonstrate a tool that can also be used
