      A little about me...
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I am in this course to learn more about web design because what I know
        so far has many gaps and I haven't used it in a formal environment.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        I have created a few different websites for hackathons, class projects
        and personal use but they have not been great in my opinion. Here are
        two examples of what I've created.
        <ul>

            </a>:
            <div style="width:700px;overflow:auto">
              <pre>
            A Hackaton concept that mimicked linked in but catered to matching
            POC students and POC owned business.The website also provides a
            directory of POC owned business in metro areas with an interactive,
            searchable map. At the time, only Dallas is working but this was
            only a concept for a hackaton.
          </pre>
            </div>
          </li>

              345: Latinx Digital Cultures
            </a>:
            <div style="width:700px;overflow:auto">

              <pre>
            A Class project that focuses on the impact of Covid on Latinx
            populations in the largest metro areas of the United States. It
            contains interactive maps and tables for users to explore the data
            that I scraped as well as a resource center to download and access
            the source of the data collected.
            </pre>
            </div>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <em>
          Both of these examples are based on the original website template that
          I created for the hackaton in 2020 with Bootstrap. I have been coding
          on and off for about 10 years but only recently got serious about it
          in the past 5 or 6 years.</em>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        In this course, I want to get a formal understanding of the web
        development process as well as dive into the backend implementation of
        code because in order to create the class website listed above, I had to
        use python packages to create the maps and charts and then exported them
        into HTML, json and JS files to be displayed. It was very difficult to
        do with my limited understanding so I hope to be able to replicate
        something similar in an easier and more effective way.

            Advanced Command Line:<br>
            <blockquote
              cite="https://omundy.github.io/learn-computing/slides/command-line.html">
              This command line tutorial goes more in depth than the shorter
              tutorial. One thing this course taught me was about the
              <code>pwd</code> command that prints the current directory. Other
              useful commands like '<code>ls</code> to list the directory and
              <code>cd</code> to change directory are also shown. A bit more
              advanced commands like <code>mkdir</code>, <code>touch</code> and
              <code>vim</code>/ <code>nano</code> are shown as a way to create
              and edit directories and files.

            How to use APIs:
            <blockquote
              cite="https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/data-apis.md">
              The activity explains how to use APIs to request and obtain data.
              First, a simple example is shown through a URL that can be visited
              in a browser. Then, Postman is used to demonstrate a tool that can
              also be used to further explore the capability of APIs. Then, its
              shown how to get data using requests through Postman by filling in
              specific query information. </blockquote>

              Exhausting a Crowd
            </a>:
                <tt>Exhausting a Crowd is a website that shows the little things happening around us. I am not sure if users or the website it self tags different tasks happening around the world through pre-recorded video from webcams in various different cities. Its quite interesting because it shows the likely possibility of AI and surveillance programs working together. </tt><br>

              ScareMail is an extension that generates text through NLP in order to trick NSA surveillance programs into looking deeper at the emails being sent. The program focuses on putting more stain on the NSAs program in order to combat government surveillance.</tt><br>

             FloodNet
            </a>:
              <tt>I first heard of FloodNet and the Electronic Disturbance Theater in my SPA 345 Latinx Digital Cultures class. We spoke briefly about Ricardo Dominguez's various attempts to disturb government surveillance and interrupt other online government activities. The FloodNet program was introduced in the late 1990s in order to perform an online sit-in in favor of the Zapatista rebels. It acted as modern day DDOS attack. The interesting part is the work the EDT is doing against what they see as injustices and how they created an online sit-in.</tt> <br>
